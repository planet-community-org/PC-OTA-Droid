android_packages_apps_planetupdater
===================================

# Project Description

This is the open-source repository for the newly revamped Planet Computers OTA
app. We aim to support Android versions from 8.1 up. The community currently 
maintains it.

This means that if the Gemini PDA gets a software update that fixes Android
8.1, we can *hopefully* embed this app to replace the broken updater. The same
goes for the Cosmo Communicator, Astro Slide, and future devices.

My (@shymega) vision is essentially to include this repository in the AOSP
sources for Gemini, Cosmo, and Astro, and revolutionise the OTA delivery mechanism.
