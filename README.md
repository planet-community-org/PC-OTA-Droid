android_packages_apps_planetupdater
===================================

# Project Description

This is the open-source repository for the new revamped Planet Computers OTA
app. We aim to support Android versions from 8.1 up.

This means that if the Gemini PDA gets a software update that fixes Android
8.1, we can *hopefully* embed this app to replace the broken updater. The same
goes for the Cosmo Communicator.

My (@shymega) vision is essentially to include this repository in the AOSP
sources for Gemini, Cosmo, and Astro, and revolutise the OTA delivery mechanism.
